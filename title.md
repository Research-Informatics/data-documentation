## Health Related Social Needs and Social Determinants of Health

Social Determinants of Health and Health Equity Data  
This resource describes social determinants of health (SDOH), health-related social needs, and other data fields relevant to health equity research that are available from the CDW for Research – including data definitions, descriptions, sources, and limitations. 

Given the nature of SDOH data, available data fields are dynamic and often evolve in various clinical and data systems. Reach out to the cdw@bmc.org with questions. 

The document outlines data available in Epic. If you are interested in SDOH data prior to Epic implementation (prior to June 2015), e-mail our team at cdw@bmc.org to discuss options for data available from legacy systems.

Using this Document to Select Study-Relevant Data: A Comment on Health Equity Tourism
The CDW for Research can work with you to identify specific data to leverage for your study. We encourage research teams to carefully select the data fields that have direct relevance to the research study’s question. The CDW for Research considers race to be a social construct and encourages researchers to think critically about using race and ethnicity as a proxy for structural racism or experiences with racism in their research. We encourage research teams to read about Health Equity Tourism  and avoid this phenomenon on behalf of the patients we serve. 

How this Resource is Organized 
This resource lists main data elements, patient phenotypes, and algorithms as well as discrete underlying data fields that could also be leveraged as relevant to research studies. Data are displayed as:
